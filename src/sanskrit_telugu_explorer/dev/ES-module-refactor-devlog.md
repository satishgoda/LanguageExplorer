# ES-module refactor — Devlog

Date: 2025-08-14
Author: Automated devlog (tooling)

## One-line summary
Converted the demo's main JavaScript into an ES module (exported `init()` and `languageData`), updated the HTML to load it with `type="module"` and added/cleaned a short README with instructions to run the demo locally via a static server.

## Checklist (requirements)
- [x] Convert `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` to an ES module and expose a clean entrypoint (`init`).
- [x] Update `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` to import the module using `type="module"` and call `init()`.
- [x] Add a small `src/README.md` showing how to run the demo locally (static server instructions).

## Motivation
The original script executed startup logic at load-time (implicit global script). Converting to an ES module with an explicit `init()` provides:
- safer scoping and strict-mode by default,
- an explicit lifecycle to initialize DOM wiring,
- easier reuse/import in other modules or test harnesses,
- compatibility with modern bundlers and dev servers.

## Files changed / added
- `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` — refactored to ES module; `init()` exported; `languageData` exported.
- `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` — script changed to:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { init } from './js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js';
  init();
</script>
```

- `src/README.md` — small quick-start showing how to run `python3 -m http.server 8000` (or `http-server`) and why a web server is required.
- `README.md` (root) — short pointer / H1 updated.

## What changed in the code (high level)
- Removed `window.onload` side-effects and moved DOM wiring into `export function init()`.
- Preserved all rendering, event handlers, speech synthesis, and localStorage logic but deferred their setup until `init()` is invoked.
- Kept `languageData` available as a named export for potential programmatic access or testing.

## Key implementation notes
- `init()` responsibility:
  - query DOM elements (buttons, grids, view container),
  - wire event listeners,
  - populate character grids and initial views,
  - register/refresh speech synthesis voices,
  - load session (if present) and apply theme.

- HTML import is static and relative; modules must be served over HTTP(S) and the file must be reachable at `./js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` relative to this HTML file.

- Speech synthesis:
  - Uses `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` and heuristics to pick `sa-IN`/`te-IN` voices when available.
  - If no appropriate voice exists, speech calls are skipped.

## Conversation & change log summary (from the chat)
- User requested two items:
  1. Convert the JS to an ES module and update HTML to use `type="module"`.
  2. Add a tiny README demonstrating how to run the demo locally.

- Actions taken by the agent:
  - Read the current `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` to understand code and dependencies.
  - Converted the JS file to export `init()` and `languageData`.
  - Moved DOM wiring and startup code into `init()`.
  - Updated `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` to import the module and call `init()` inside a `<script type="module">` block.
  - Created a concise `src/README.md` with static-server run instructions and a root `README.md` pointer.
  - Iteratively fixed README formatting; multiple edits were made to clean duplicates and lint issues.

- Issues encountered:
  - Iterative README edits triggered markdown lint warnings (duplicate headings, hard tabs, spacing). Several edit attempts were required to produce a clean `src/README.md`.
  - A few patch attempts failed with invalid context during cleanup; final README was written and verified.

## How to run the demo locally (verify)
From the project `src/` directory run either:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

or (if you prefer node):

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
```

Then open:

http://localhost:8000/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html

Notes:
- Serving via a web server is required because ES modules are loaded with fetch-like requests and won't load reliably via `file://`.
- If speech doesn't work, check browser speech-synthesis support and available voices.

## Verification performed
- `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` was inspected to confirm it exports `init()` and `languageData` and that DOM wiring was moved into `init()`.
- `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` was inspected to confirm the `type="module"` script imports `init` and calls it.
- `src/README.md` was created/cleaned to contain clear run instructions.

## Quality gates & status
- Build / lint: N/A for this static demo (no build system). Markdown lint issues were resolved for `src/README.md`.
- Functionality:
  - Module export/import: Done.
  - App initialization via `init()`: Done.
  - Local run instructions provided: Done.

## Remaining / follow-ups (recommended)
- Run the demo in a browser and manually verify UI flows: select characters, trigger speech, save/load session, and visit carousel.
- Add a tiny smoke test harness (optional): a small test that imports `languageData` and checks basic invariants.
- Consider adding a `package.json` dev script for easy local serving, e.g. `npm run dev` using `http-server` or `serve`.
- If planning to publish, consider bundling (esbuild/rollup) and minifying for production.

## Commit & PR notes
- Suggested commit message: `refactor(js): convert main script to ES module and expose init()`
- PR description should include: why initialization was deferred, how to run the demo locally, and any manual QA steps.

---

If you want, I can also:
- open a PR with these changes,
- add a simple `package.json` with a `dev` script, or
- run a quick smoke test that exercises `init()` in a headless browser (if you want automation).
