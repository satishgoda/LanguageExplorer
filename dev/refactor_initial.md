# Devlog — Refactor: external CSS & JS for Sanskrit/Telugu Explorer

Date: 2025-08-14

## Summary

Extracted inline CSS and JavaScript from `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` into external files and updated the HTML to reference them. Minor accessibility fix added for the theme selector. Behavior preserved.

## Checklist

- [x] Extract inline CSS into `src/css/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.css`
- [x] Extract inline JS into `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js`
- [x] Update `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` to reference external files
- [x] Preserve original UI/behavior (no logic changes)
- [x] Add accessible name for theme switcher (aria-label + `.sr-only`)

## Files created/edited

- `src/css/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.css` — externalized styles (themes, layout, components, tooltips, accessibility helper)
- `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` — externalized JS (data, rendering, events, speech, session, theme management)
- `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` — updated to link CSS/JS and added accessibility label for the theme select
- `DEVLOG_REFACTOR.md` — this devlog

## Actions taken (chronological)

1. Read `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` to locate inline style and script sections.
2. Created `src/css/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.css` and moved the entire inline `<style>` ruleset into it.
3. Created `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` and moved the entire inline `<script>` content into it.
4. Updated `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` to remove the inline blocks and add:
   - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.css">`
   - `<script src="js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js"></script>`
5. Fixed an accessibility lint issue by adding a visually-hidden label and `aria-label` to the `#theme-switcher` select. Added `.sr-only` utility to the CSS.
6. Performed content checks: confirmed files exist and no inline `&lt;style&gt;` or `&lt;script&gt;` remain (except Tailwind CDN script which was intentionally kept).

## How to test (quick)

Open the HTML directly or serve the `src/` folder:

Open directly (may work but some browser features are restricted for file://):

```bash
open src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html
```

Run a simple HTTP server (recommended):

```bash
cd src
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html
```

Verify:

- Character grids render for Sanskrit and Telugu.
- Clicking a character shows Mind Map (map view) or List (list view).
- Save/Load session uses localStorage (session persists across reload when saved).
- Theme selector applies theme variables; it has an accessible name.
- Hovering visited letters in carousel shows inverted mindmap overlay.

## Notes & next steps

- Tailwind and Google Fonts left as CDN references; can be replaced with local assets or bundled if desired.
- Can convert JS into ES module(s) and lazy-load, or split logic further for maintainability.
- I can add a tiny README, a VS Code task to serve the demo, or a git commit + suggested commit message — tell me which you prefer.

## Chat transcript (messages up to this devlog)

**User:** Refactor the html using external js, css files.

**Assistant:** I'll read the current `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` to find inline CSS/JS to extract and plan the refactor. Expecting to extract styles into `src/css/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.css` and scripts into `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js`, then update the HTML to link them. I'll read the file now.

**Assistant (action):** Read file `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` and found inline &lt;style&gt; and &lt;script&gt; sections.

**Assistant:** I'll apply a patch that (1) extracts the inline CSS into `src/css/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.css`, (2) extracts the inline JS into `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js`, and (3) updates the HTML to reference them. Expected outcome: HTML is slimmer and behavior is unchanged. Now I'll apply the edits.

**Assistant (action):** Updated `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` to reference external CSS and noted lint error about select accessible name.

**Assistant (action):** Created `src/css/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.css` with the extracted styles.

**Assistant (action):** Created `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` with the extracted script.

**Assistant (action):** Replaced the inline script in `src/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html` with `<script src="js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js"></script>`.

**Assistant:** Checkpoint: I updated the HTML to reference external CSS and JS, and created those files. Next I will run a quick check to ensure the files exist and there are no obvious path issues; then I'll run a minimal HTML validation by opening the file in a headless check (we can at least output file lists). I'll list the src directory to confirm.

**Assistant (action):** Confirmed `src/` contains `css/`, `js/`, and `sanskrit_telugu_explorer.html`. Confirmed `src/css/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.css` and `src/js/sanskrit_telugu_explorer.js` exist.

**Assistant:** Next I fixed the accessibility lint by adding an `aria-label` and a visually hidden label to the theme switcher, and added `.sr-only` to the CSS.

**Assistant (action):** Applied accessibility fix and re-checked that no inline style/script remain (except Tailwind CDN script which was intentionally kept).

**Assistant (final):** Created external CSS and JS, updated HTML, added accessibility fix, and provided quick test commands and next steps.
